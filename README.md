# Snek game

**Play it:** <a href="https://cotabas.github.io/Snek/">here</a>

**Made with:**
Javascript, CSS, and HTML

It's a graph of \<div\> tags, the background changes as the snek head moves and trails it's position.
I vaguely remember working on a snake game in math class on my ti-83+ (or was it 82?) so this was the first thing that came to mind once I had the power to create 


**Bugs:**
1. If a food gets placed on the Snek it will turn white after the snek moves off of it
2. cookie needs an expiration date otherwise is expires when the browser is closed

**Todo:**
1. Snek color change option
2. Difficulty option
3. Profit
